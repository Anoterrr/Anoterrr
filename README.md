# 👋 Welcome to my Data Engineering Playground!

> *"In God we trust. All others must bring data."* — W. Edwards Deming

## 🔍 Who Am I?

I'm a data engineer who believes that ETL should stand for "Extremely Terrific Lifestyle" rather than just Extract, Transform, Load. When I'm not wrangling unruly datasets into submission, you can find me explaining to my friends why database normalization is actually fascinating conversation material at dinner parties.

## 💾 What I Do

I craft data pipelines so elegant they'd make Marie Kondo proud. My code doesn't just run—it performs, like a well-orchestrated symphony where every function plays its part perfectly. Except when there's a bug, then it's more like free jazz.

```
def my_life(coffee):
    while True:
        if coffee.empty():
            refill(coffee)
        process_data()
        debug_previous_solution()
        commit("Fixed bug. No, really this time.")
```

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Scala, and enough Bash to be dangerous
- **Frameworks**: Apache Spark, Airflow, Kafka, dbt
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Snowflake, BigQuery
- **Cloud**: AWS, GCP, Azure (I'm cloud-agnostic, like a good data nomad)
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes (because manually deploying is so 2010)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins (automation is not just a luxury, it's a lifestyle)

## 📊 My Data Philosophy

1. **Data should be clean** - Unlike my desk
2. **Pipelines should be reliable** - Unlike my gym attendance
3. **Documentation is crucial** - Future me always thanks past me for this
4. **Optimization matters** - Both for queries and coffee brewing methods

## 🚀 Projects That Might Impress You

Check out my pinned repositories below! From streaming real-time analytics to data warehouse implementations that would make Kimball proud, I've built systems that turn chaotic data into actionable insights.

## 🔮 The Future is Data-Driven

I'm currently exploring:
- Building MLOps pipelines that don't require a PhD to maintain
- Implementing Lambda and Kappa architectures (and explaining the difference at parties)
- Finding the perfect balance between data governance and actually getting things done
- Discovering if it's possible to explain what I do to my grandparents

## 🎯 Fun Facts

- I can explain dimensional modeling using only Star Wars analogies
- I've written a query so complex it made my database apologize
- I once debugged a pipeline issue while hiking (the solution came to me at the summit)
- I believe "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" applies to databases too
